For the downstream workflow, we will follow the tutorial from the Jupyter Notebook embedded below.

<!--
Guide on how to use Jupyter Notebook in the Proteomics Sandbox Application (git clone)

-->

You can work with the notebook both on your local machine and in the Proteomics Sandbox application.  
To do so, download the repository containing the Jupyter Notebook by executing the following snippet in your terminal:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/veitveit/training-quantitative-proteomics.git
```

In the Proteomics Sandbox application:  

1. Navigate to the **`Applications`** menu in the upper left corner.  
2. Go to **`Development`**.  
3. Click on **`Jupyter Notebook`**.  

From there, you can select the notebook located in the directory:
  
**`/training-quantitative-proteomics/03_Cluster_Analysis/`**

This directory will be within the folder where you cloned the material in your terminal.

You can now proceed with the multivariate analysis of the material.
